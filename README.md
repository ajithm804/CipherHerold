## Cipher Herold - Image Steganography Application

**Description:**
Developed a Python-based desktop application that enables secure communication through image steganography. The application allows users to hide sensitive text messages within PNG and JPG images without visible alteration, providing an additional layer of privacy protection.

**Technical Details:**
- Implemented using Python with Tkinter for the GUI
- Utilized the Stegano library for LSB (Least Significant Bit) steganography implementation
- Created a user-friendly interface with features for loading images, encoding/decoding hidden messages, and saving modified images
- Incorporated error handling and user confirmation dialogs for secure operation

**Key Features:**
- Text hiding and retrieval within image files
- Support for multiple image formats (PNG, JPG)
- Intuitive user interface with scroll functionality for handling longer messages
- Image preview functionality
- Secure encryption/decryption workflow with user confirmation

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Python programming
- GUI development
- Data security principles
- Application development
- File I/O operations
- Error handling

This project showcases your understanding of both programming concepts and security principles, making it a valuable addition to your resume, especially if you're targeting roles in software development, cybersecurity, or information security.
